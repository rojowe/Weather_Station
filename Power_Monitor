Voltage Divider to monitor solar voltage, and another to monitor the battery voltage
- battery voltage will never exceed 5v (1s Lipo) (0-5v range)
- Solar voltage will never exceed 6v (5v Panel)  (0-8v range (buffer on the high end, will still have good resolution))

Battery Voltage Divider 
- Vin = 5v
- R1 = 2000
- R2 = 3300
- Vout = 3.11v

Solar Voltage Divider
- Vin = 8v
- R1 = 4700
- R2 = 3300
- Vout = 3.30v
