1) Deep-Sleep Mode requires that all contents of the sketch should be placed within the Setup loop, the main loop is never reached 
2) Wake up
3) Gather Sensor Data 
- Average LDR reading 
- Temperature, Humidity, & Pressure 
- Battery Voltage & Solar Voltage 
3) Solar Tracking   
- If the LDR sensors average is under the threshold, & there is no output from the solar panel, there is no need to activate solar tracking
- If the LDR sensors average is above the threshold, activate solar tracking sequence 
  - North-East vs. South-East vs. South-West vs. North-West 
  - NE + SE > NW + SW = Turn East until values are roughly equal, else if NE + SE < NW + SW = Turn West until values are roughly equal
  - NE + NW > SE + SW = Turn North until values are roughly equal, else if NE + NW < SE + SW = Turn South until values are roughly equal
  - Solar Voltage should be used to track the highest output positions 
4) Connect to Wifi & send data over MQTT 
- LDR Average 
- Temperature 
- Humidity
- Pressure 
- Battery Voltage 
- Solar Voltage
5) Delay for 30 seconds for uploading a new sketch
5) Deep-Sleep for 10 minutes
