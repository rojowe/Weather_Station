Since I am using the NodeMCU ESP-8266 based board, I only have 1 analog pin available. This is a challenge since I need to read:
- 4x LDR (Solar tracking)
- 2x Voltage Dividers (Battery & Solar Voltage)

The Solution: Multiplexing
- In short, all 6 signals will be connected to the analog pin, and using digital pins, one by one each will be allowed to communicate with
the controller for the few ms needed. Diodes will be used to isolate signals from interfiering with eachother 
- The LDRs should ber relatively simple to multiplex, A0 is their ground and Vin is the +5v supply when using a single LDR, since I only
have the 1 input, I will power all 4 LDR's by writing their individual digital pins high, giving them +5v when I need to read their values,
and writing their pins low, 0v, when I don't need them. This will eliminate noise creating unreadable values
- The voltage monitoring brings about a different set of challenges, I'll need to use some kind of transistor to pass the voltage signal along only 
when desired, the battery and solar monitoring can be achieved by controlling the signal through a transistor to the A0 pin. When signal is 
not needed, simply send a low value to the transistor, and the gate closes
